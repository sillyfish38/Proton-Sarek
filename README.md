# Proton-For-Old-Vulkan or "Sarek"

Sarek (Proton-For-Old-Vulkan): A custom Proton build with [DXVK-Sarek](https://github.com/pythonlover02/DXVK-Sarek) for users with GPUs that support Vulkan 1.1+ but not Vulkan 1.3, or for those with non-Vulkan support who want a plug-and-play option featuring personal patches.

**Why does this repository exist?**

Because there are still users with GPUs that support Vulkan 1.1+ but not Vulkan 1.3, and others with non Vulkan support. Those who can use DXVK often rely on older versions of Proton, which suffer from lower compatibility and performance compared to newer builds. Meanwhile, users dependent on WineD3D often face a poor gaming experience. This repository provides patched versions of Proton and/or GE-Proton to try to solve these problems. This is done by using [DXVK-Sarek](https://github.com/pythonlover02/DXVK-Sarek) and adding tweaks and [Parameters](#Sarek) to Proton.

Please be aware that this is a custom build of Proton and is **not** affiliated with Valve's Proton. If you encounter any issues specific to my Proton build from this repository that do not occur with Valve's version, kindly refrain from submitting a bug report to Valve's bug GitHub. Instead, please report the issue directly on this GitHub. Thank you for your understanding!

One additional note its that DXVK-Sarek its also supported on [proton-cachyos](https://github.com/CachyOS/proton-cachyos), for using it you must add this env var to your launch options:

```
PROTON_DXVK_SAREK=1
```

## Parameters:

### Proton:
This are set on the Launch Options of a game on Steam, example:

	PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 PROTON_NO_ESYNC=1 mesa_glthread=true %command%

The Optimzation variables are set on the same way on the launch options

[Proton Launch Parameters](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/tree/proton_9.0?tab=readme-ov-file#runtime-config-options)

[GE-Proton Launch Parameters](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom?tab=readme-ov-file#modification)

[Proton-Sarek Launch Parameters](#Sarek)

**Note:** Because Proton-Sarek is based on GE-Proton and that one is based on Proton, the bast majority of launch parameters under both GE-Proton and Valve Proton will work on Proton-Sarek.

## Optimization:

### System:
First of all lets start with the must have, Gamemodem, Zram and MangoHud.

| Tool/Library          | Description                                                                                                      | Link                                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `GameMode`               | GameMode is a daemon/lib combo for Linux that allows games to request a set of optimizations to be temporarily applied to the host OS and/or a game process. | [GitHub - GameMode](https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode) |
| `Zram-Generator`       | Zram, formerly called compcache, is a Linux kernel module for creating a compressed block device in RAM.        | [GitHub - Zram-Generator](https://github.com/systemd/zram-generator) |
| `MangoHud`              | MangoHud is a Vulkan and OpenGL overlay for monitoring FPS, temperatures, CPU/GPU load and more.              | [GitHub - MangoHud](https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud) |

My personal recomendation its to search a tutorial for the installation of the three in your favorite Linux Distro *;P*

### Sarek:
These are the custom parameters introduced in Sarek to provide fallback rendering options or controll over the build.

| Environment Variable              | Description                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PROTON_SAREK_PROFILE`            | Changes the [Sarek Profile](#Sarek-Profile), it accepts the next values: `base`, `default` and `agg`.                               |
| `DISABLE_OGL_THREAD=[0/1]`         | Disables OpenGL Threaded Optimizations, might increase or decrease fps depending on the game.                                                 |
| `PROTON_SOFTWARE_RENDER=[0/1]`    | Uses LLVMpipe and Lavapipe for CPU-based rendering for OpenGL and Vulkan, more info on the [Software Rendering](#Software-Rendering) section |
| `USE_NVAPI=[0/1]`    | Enables the use of NVAPI. It is disabled by default on Proton-Sarek to avoid possible issues with NVIDIA GPUs in games that use NVAPI features not supported by DXVK-Sarek.|

### Software Rendering:

Before trying to use the `PROTON_SOFTWARE_RENDER` parameter, ensure your system meets the software rasterizer requirements for the program/wrapper API:

**Requirements for Using LLVMpipe (OpenGL Software Rendering):**
- **Mesa Version**: Any recent version (LLVMpipe is well supported in current Mesa releases)
- **CPU**: Multi-core recommended for better performance

**Requirements for Using Lavapipe (Vulkan Software Rendering):**
- **Mesa Version**: 20.3 or newer
- **CPU**: Multi-core recommended for better performance

#### Lavapipe Important Notes:
##### Note 1:
On some Linux distributions, the Vulkan software rasterizer (Lavapipe) is available in separate packages and not bundled directly with Mesa. Here its an easy way to check if its included in your distributions Mesa installation:

```
MESA_VK_DEVICE_SELECT=list vulkaninfo
```

The output should be something similar to this:

```
selectable devices:
  GPU 0: 10de:128b "NVIDIA GeForce GT 710" discrete GPU 0000:01:00.0
  GPU 1: 10005:0 "llvmpipe (LLVM 20.1.8, 256 bits)" CPU 0000:00:00.0
 ```

If the output its not like the above that means that your Distro doesnt install the `vulkan mesa layer` by default and you will need to install additional packages.

If there its no entry that mentions `llvmpipe`, you need to install additional packages specific to your distribution.


##### Note 2:
For DXVK games you can just add `PROTON_SOFTWARE_RENDER=1` to the launch options.

##### Note 3:
For Vulkan and D3D12 games, you may need to manually set the `VK_DRIVER_FILES` to the Lavapipe icd.json file (usually a variation of lvp_icd.json) if the default target is incorrect, uses an incorrect path or if the system is preventing Proton-Sarek from changing the environment variable.

Try using the following command:
```
PROTON_SOFTWARE_RENDER=1 VK_DRIVER_FILES="/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/lvp_icd.i686.json:/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/lvp_icd.x86_64.json"
```

In other cases, you might need to modify the value of `VK_DRIVER_FILES` to correctly point to the multiple lvp_icd.json in your system.

### Sarek Profile:
The profiles can be changed using the `PROTON_SAREK_PROFILE` parameter, which accepts the following values: `base`, `default`, and `agg`.

**Configuration Options**:

- **"base"(Valve's default settings):**
  - Disables logging for Wine, DXVK, and VKD3D to enhance performance.

- **"default" (Default Value):**
  - Inherits all settings from the Base configuration.
  - Introduces a set of fixes for OpenGL/Vulkan for old GPUs.
  - Set `PROTON_SET_GAME_DRIVE=1` to help with moding.
  - Set `PROTON_DISABLE_NVAPI=1` to avoid possible issues with NVIDIA GPUs in games that use NVAPI features not supported by DXVK-Sarek
  - Use Mesa and NVIDIA OpenGL Thread Optimization, to try to mittigate WineD3D stutters while using the OpenGL backend.
    - Note: This might have a negative performance hit for games that use OpenGL instead of the DirectX family. You can disable it with the `DISABLE_OGL_THREAD=1` env var.

- **"agg":**
  - Represents an aggressive performance mode, with all features from the default configuration, plus the next:

  **OpenGL/WineD3D:**

  **NVIDIA:**
  - Forces no Vsync.
  - Forces rendering textures under performance settings instead of the default quality settings.
  - Forces no Full-Screen Anti-Aliasing (FSAA) and FXAA.
  - Prevents the usage of anisotropic filtering.

  **Mesa:**
  - Forces no Vsync.
  - Disables error checking within the API to avoid CPU performance losses.
  - Disables dithering.
  - Disables MSAA

  **DXVK:**

  **NVIDIA && Mesa:**
  - Disable vertical synchronization (vsync)
  - Set the maximum tessellation factor to 8, limiting tessellation detail to improve performance in games that overuse it.
  - Enables relaxed pipeline barriers for UAV (unordered access view) writes in D3D11, which can improve performance (with a risk of rendering glitches).
  - Tell the driver to ignore certain graphics barriers around UAV writes from fragment shaders, aiming to reduce synchronization overhead on D3D11.
  - Disable anisotropic filtering.
  - Disable the declaration of vertex positions as invariant in D3D, which may reduce a small performance cost (at the potential risk of increased Z-fighting).
  - Enables fast (but less precise) floating point quirk emulation in D3D9, which can speed up computations in games that rely on these operations.
  - Set `DXVK_ALL_CORES=1` to use all the CPU cores for shader compilation.

  **Vulkan:**

  **Mesa:**
  - Disable vertical synchronization (vsync)

> [!NOTE]
> The agg profile is intended to be used on PCs with weak GPUs or when software rendering its being used, trying to help with stuttering and some extra fps, visual glitches are expected, so please do not report them if you cannot replicate the problem without using the agg profile.

### Additional Tips:

1. If that of a above its not enought, you might want to check newer kernel versions or patched/customiced kernels(zen, liquorix, xanmod, cachyoskernel, clearkernel, etc), i personally recomend the vanilla kernel tought.

2. You might want to use the drop cache command of the linux kernel before playing a game to free some ram, you should do:

   ```
   sudo su
   echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
   exit
   ```

3. You might want to use Mangohud to cap your fps and set the fps cap mode, this its an example:

   ```
   MANGOHUD_CONFIG=fps_limit=60,fps_limit_method=early,no_display mangohud %command%
   ```

   What does this do? `MANGOHUD_CONFIG=parameters,parameters` overwrites the current MangoHud config. Another option is to add the following to the MangoHud config file:

   ```
   fps_limit=60
   fps_limit_method=early
   no_display
   ```
   You can remove the `no_display` option (which hides the MangoHud HUD), change the `fps_limit` value to any number you like, and change the `fps_limit_method` to `early` (for smoother frametimes) or `late` (for the lowest latency).

   Check out the [MangoHud GitHub repository](https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud) for more information and configuration options.

   As an example here its my current [MangoHud.conf](https://github.com/pythonlover02/Proton-Sarek/blob/onlyfixes/extras/MangoHud.conf) file.

## Building:

Follow these steps to add to your Proton Build the Sarek patches:

### 1. Download/Compile Proton
- **Option 1:** Compile your Proton build from source.

- **Option 2:** Download a precompiled Proton build (GE-Proton or Valve's Stable releases are the only ones officially supported).

### 2. Get the Sarek Repo
- Clone or download the repo.

### 3. Rename the Proton Executable (if necessary)
- If you're using **GE-Proton**, no need to rename anything, as the default `proton` file works out of the box.
- For **Valve's Proton** Stable builds:
  - Rename `proton` (from the Sarek-Patches dir) to something else like `proton-ge`.
  - Rename the `proton-valve` file from the Sarek-Patches to `proton`.

### 4. Modify Compatibilitytool.vdf, Version and Proton Files
- Edit `compatibilitytool.vdf`, `version` and `proton` files to reflect the name of your build (replace "Proton-Sarek" with your custom build name).

### 5. Run the Build Script

- Execute the script with superuser privileges:

		sudo /path/to/make.sh

- or for the async build:

		sudo /path/to/make-async.sh

When prompted, provide the path to the Proton build you downloaded or compiled.

### 6. Enjoy Your Custom Proton Build!

- Thats all, enjoy *:)*
